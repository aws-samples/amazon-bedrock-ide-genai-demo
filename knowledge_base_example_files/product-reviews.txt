2. ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
Location: United States
Item: Cotton T-Shirt 3-Pack
"Great basic tees for everyday wear. Material is soft and hasn't shrunk after multiple washes. Only giving 4 stars because the white shirt is slightly see-through. Otherwise, fantastic value for money."

3. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)
Location: UK
Item: High-Waisted Jeans
"Finally found my perfect pair of jeans! The fit is amazing and they're so comfortable. Usually struggle with the waist-hip ratio but these are spot on. Already ordered a second pair."

4. ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)
Location: Australia
Item: Summer Dress
"Beautiful pattern and comfortable material, but the sizing runs large. Had to return for a smaller size. Also, the dress is quite long - needed hemming. Nice quality though!"

5. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)
Location: Germany
Item: Wool Sweater
"Exceptional quality sweater. Not itchy at all, which is rare for wool. Has maintained its shape after several washes. Perfect for both office wear and casual occasions."

6. ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
Location: Japan
Item: Athletic Leggings
"Very comfortable and squat-proof! The pocket design is clever and fits my phone perfectly. Removing one star because the color faded slightly after washing. Still recommend!"

7. ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)
Location: Spain
Item: Linen Blazer
"Love the style and material, but the buttons started coming loose after a few wears. Had to reinforce them myself. Good for summer office wear, but quality control could be better."

8. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)
Location: France
Item: Silk Blouse
"C'est parfait! The quality of the silk is outstanding, and the cut is very flattering. Have worn it for both work and evening events. Washes beautifully with proper care."

9. ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
Location: Ireland
Item: Rain Jacket
"Great waterproof jacket that actually keeps you dry! The zip pockets are a huge plus. Would give 5 stars but the hood is a bit small. Perfect for our rainy weather though!"

10. ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
Location: New Zealand
Item: Merino Wool Base Layer
"Brilliant for hiking and outdoor activities. Keeps you warm without overheating and doesn't retain odors. Slightly pricey but worth the investment. Sizing is accurate too."

1. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)
Country: Canada
Item Type: Household - Robot Vacuum Cleaner
"Absolutely life-changing! This robot vacuum has saved me hours of cleaning time each week. Great on both hardwood and carpet, and the app integration is seamless. Battery life is impressive - covers my entire main floor on one charge. Worth every penny!"

2. ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
Country: USA
Item Type: Household - Smart Air Purifier
"Really happy with this purchase. Has helped with my allergies tremendously and the air quality indicator is a neat feature. Took off one star because the replacement filters are a bit pricey, but otherwise excellent product."

3. ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)
Country: UK
Item Type: Household - Collapsible Storage Bins
"Decent storage solution for the price. They look nice and fold flat when not in use, but I wish they were a bit sturdier. The fabric seems like it might tear if overfilled. Good for lightweight items though."

4. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)
Country: Australia
Item Type: Household - Cordless Stick Vacuum
"Best vacuum I've ever owned! The battery life is fantastic, it's lightweight, and the wall mount storage is brilliant. Love how it converts to a handheld for stairs and furniture. My back thanks you!"

5. ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
Country: Ireland
Item Type: Household - Kitchen Organization Set
"Beautiful bamboo organizers that have transformed my messy drawers into Instagram-worthy spaces. Only complaint is that some of the dividers don't fit perfectly in standard drawer sizes, but overall very pleased."

6. ⭐⭐ (2/5)
Country: New Zealand
Item Type: Household - Steam Mop
"Mixed feelings about this one. It heats up quickly and works well on tile, but the water tank is too small and needs constant refilling. The cord could be longer too. Wouldn't buy again at this price point."

7. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)
Country: USA
Item Type: Household - Laundry Hamper with Wheels
"Where has this been all my life? The wheels make it so easy to transport laundry from bedroom to laundry room, and the sorting compartments are genius. Sturdy construction and looks great too!"

8. ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
Country: Germany
Item Type: Household - Shower Caddy System
"Very clever design with adjustable shelves and strong suction cups. Installation was straightforward and it hasn't fallen once in 3 months. Only downside is the price, but quality is worth it."

9. ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)
Country: Singapore
Item Type: Household - Under-Sink Organizer
"Good concept but execution could be better. The sliding drawers are smooth and it maximizes space well, but assembly was a nightmare. Instructions were unclear and some parts didn't align properly."

10. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)
Country: Canada
Item Type: Household - Closet Organization System
"Completely transformed my closet! The modular design allowed me to customize it to my space perfectly. Installation took a while but the result is worth it. Great quality materials and everything feels solid."

1. ★☆☆☆☆ (1/5) | USA | Item: File Folders
"Complete waste of money. These folders fall apart after minimal use - the tabs break off and the edges are already fraying after just two weeks. Save yourself the frustration and buy from somewhere else."

2. ★★☆☆☆ (2/5) | Canada | Item: Desk Organizer
"The design looks nice in pictures, but the quality is disappointing. Plastic feels cheap and flimsy. At least it holds my supplies, but definitely not worth the price point."

3. ★★★☆☆ (3/5) | UK | Item: Stapler
"Mixed feelings about this one. It works fine for small jobs, but constantly jams with anything over 10 pages. The build quality is decent, though the loading mechanism is awkward."

4. ★☆☆☆☆ (1/5) | Australia | Item: Printer Paper
"Terrible quality paper. Causes frequent printer jams and the thickness is inconsistent throughout the ream. Had to throw out half the box due to wrinkled sheets."

5. ★★☆☆☆ (2/5) | USA | Item: Sticky Notes
"The adhesive is a joke - notes fall off within hours of posting. Colors are also much duller than shown online. Would not recommend."

6. ★★★☆☆ (3/5) | Ireland | Item: Binder Clips
"Average at best. The clips work fine but rust rather quickly. Package arrived with several clips already showing signs of corrosion. On the plus side, they're strong enough for thick documents."

7. ★☆☆☆☆ (1/5) | Canada | Item: Mechanical Pencils
"These pencils break constantly! The lead seems to shatter inside the mechanism, making them unusable. Customer service was unhelpful when I tried to return them."

8. ★★☆☆☆ (2/5) | USA | Item: Desk Calendar
"Poor print quality - some dates are barely readable. The paper is thin and tears easily when turning pages. The only positive is the size is convenient for my desk."

9. ★☆☆☆☆ (1/5) | New Zealand | Item: Rubber Bands
"Absolutely terrible. These bands dry out and break within weeks. Found several broken bands in the package before even using them. Complete waste of money."

10. ★★★☆☆ (3/5) | UK | Item: Push Pins
"Decent pins but overpriced for what you get. The colors aren't as vibrant as advertised, and about 10% of the pins in my box had bent tips. At least they're sharp and do the job."

1. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)
Country: United States
Item: Honey Nut Oat Clusters
"Absolutely love this cereal! It stays crunchy in milk and has the perfect balance of honey sweetness. My kids actually ask for it by name now. The resealable bag is a huge plus for freshness."

2. ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
Country: Canada
Item: Berry Blast Granola
"Great taste and healthy ingredients. Only giving 4 stars because the price is a bit steep, but the quality makes up for it. Love that it's low in sugar but still flavorful."

3. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)
Country: United Kingdom
Item: Ancient Grain Medley
"Finally, a cereal that doesn't turn to mush! The mix of quinoa and ancient grains keeps me full until lunch. Worth every penny for the nutritional value."

4. ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)
Country: Australia
Item: Chocolate Crunch Loops
"Decent taste but the portion size seems to have shrunk while the price stayed the same. My kids love it, but I'll probably switch to a better value option."

5. ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
Country: Ireland
Item: Cinnamon Toast Squares
"These are addictively good! The cinnamon flavor is spot-on. Would give 5 stars but they could use less sugar. Still a family favorite."

6. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)
Country: United States
Item: Protein Power Flakes
"Best high-protein cereal I've found! No chalky aftertaste like other protein cereals. Perfect for post-workout breakfast. Please never discontinue this!"

7. ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)
Country: New Zealand
Item: Fruit & Nut Granola
"Love the mix of ingredients, but recent batches have been inconsistent. Sometimes too many nuts, sometimes hardly any. Good when it's right though!"

8. ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
Country: Canada
Item: Maple Pecan Clusters
"Such a comforting breakfast option! The maple flavor is authentic (trust me, I'm Canadian!). Would be 5 stars but some clusters are too hard."

9. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)
Country: United States
Item: Multi-Grain Rice Puffs
"Perfect for my gluten-sensitive family! Light, crispy, and doesn't get soggy quickly. Also great for making treats with marshmallows."

10. ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)
Country: United Kingdom
Item: Rainbow Wheat Hoops
"The cereal itself is good, but the food coloring seems to turn the milk an odd shade. My children enjoy it, though I wish they'd use natural coloring."

1. ★☆☆☆☆ (1/5) | USA | Item: Energy Drink 4-Pack
"Horrible taste and the cans arrived dented. The new formula is nothing like the original - way too sweet and left a weird artificial aftertaste. Won't be buying again."

2. ★★☆☆☆ (2/5) | Canada | Item: Premium Coffee Beans
"For 'premium' coffee beans, these were surprisingly stale. Package date showed they were fresh but they lacked any aroma. The taste was mediocre at best. Only giving 2 stars because customer service was helpful with the refund."

3. ★★★☆☆ (3/5) | UK | Item: Fruit Juice Bundle
"Mixed feelings about this one. While the apple and orange juices were fine, the grape juice tasted watered down. Also, the packaging is excessive - too much plastic waste. Decent value but needs improvement."

4. ★☆☆☆☆ (1/5) | Australia | Item: Sparkling Water 12-Pack
"Half the cans were completely flat when they arrived. What's the point of sparkling water that isn't sparkling? Complete waste of money and terrible quality control."

5. ★★☆☆☆ (2/5) | Ireland | Item: Hot Chocolate Mix
"The picture showed a rich, creamy drink but what I got was thin and watery. Had to use twice the recommended amount to get any chocolate flavor. Very disappointing considering the price."

6. ★★★☆☆ (3/5) | USA | Item: Green Tea Bags
"Average quality at best. The tea bags rip easily and leave debris in the cup. The flavor is okay, but I've had better for less money. Packaging is nice though."

7. ★☆☆☆☆ (1/5) | Germany | Item: Sports Drink Variety Pack
"Terrible experience. Three bottles were leaking on arrival, and the taste is nothing like what's advertised. The 'tropical' flavor tastes like medicine. Complete disappointment."

8. ★★☆☆☆ (2/5) | Canada | Item: Coconut Water 6-Pack
"The coconut water has an odd pink tinge and tastes fermented. Checked the expiration date and it should've been good for months. Something's definitely off with the production quality."

9. ★★★☆☆ (3/5) | USA | Item: Cold Brew Coffee
"It's just okay. The price point is too high for what you get. The taste is decent but not as smooth as advertised. The bottle design makes it awkward to pour without spilling."

10. ★☆☆☆☆ (1/5) | UK | Item: Protein Shake Bundle
"Absolutely disgusting. The chocolate flavor is bearable but the vanilla tastes like chemicals. Also caused stomach issues. Save your money and buy elsewhere."

1. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (USA) - Liquid Foundation
"This foundation is absolutely incredible! Perfect coverage without feeling heavy, and it lasted my entire 12-hour shift. My sensitive skin hasn't had any reactions. Worth every penny!"

2. ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Canada) - Mascara
"Love how it makes my lashes look, very volumizing and doesn't clump. Taking off one star because it smudges a tiny bit by end of day, but still my go-to mascara."

3. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (UK) - Lipstick
"Finally found my perfect shade! Creamy texture, stays on for hours, and doesn't dry out my lips. I've already ordered three more colors!"

4. ⭐⭐⭐ (Australia) - Eyeshadow Palette
"Beautiful colors and good pigmentation, but there's quite a bit of fallout. Decent for the price, though I wish the shimmer shades were more intense."

5. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Ireland) - Setting Powder
"Game changer! Keeps my makeup in place all day and doesn't look cakey. Even holds up in humid weather. Will definitely repurchase!"

6. ⭐⭐ (New Zealand) - Liquid Eyeliner
"Nice color and packaging, but the tip dried out after just two weeks. Expected better longevity for the price point. Disappointed."

7. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Germany) - BB Cream
"Perfect for everyday wear! Gives just enough coverage while letting my natural skin show through. SPF is a huge plus. My new holy grail product!"

8. ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (France) - Blush
"Beautiful pigmentation and blends like a dream. The compact is a bit bulky for travel, but the product itself is wonderful. Love the natural flush it gives!"

9. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Spain) - Brow Pencil
"This brow pencil is amazing! Perfect consistency - not too soft or hard. The spoolie on the end is actually good quality. I've found my perfect match!"

10. ⭐⭐⭐ (Italy) - Concealer
"Good coverage for dark circles, but creases a bit under the eyes. Nice shade range though, and the applicator is convenient. Might try a different formula next time."

1. ★☆☆☆☆ (1/5) | USA | Item Type: Fresh Vegetables (Mixed)
"Absolutely disappointed with the quality of vegetables in my delivery. Half the carrots were broken, lettuce was wilted, and tomatoes were overripe. Wasted money as I had to throw most of it away. Not ordering produce from here again."

2. ★★☆☆☆ (2/5) | Canada | Item Type: Pre-packaged Salad Mix
"The expiration date showed 5 days left, but when I opened it the next day, everything was slimy and brown. This isn't the first time this has happened. The packaging may look nice, but what's inside is questionable."

3. ★★★☆☆ (3/5) | UK | Item Type: Fresh Vegetables (Root)
"Mixed feelings about their root vegetables. The potatoes were decent, but the onions were already sprouting and some had soft spots. Price is good, but quality control needs work."

4. ★☆☆☆☆ (1/5) | Australia | Item Type: Fresh Vegetables (Green)
"Found a caterpillar in my broccoli! While I appreciate organic produce, this is taking it too far. The broccoli itself was yellow in spots and the stems were woody. Very poor quality control."

5. ★★☆☆☆ (2/5) | Ireland | Item Type: Fresh Vegetables (Mixed)
"Ordered for delivery, got vegetables that looked like they'd been sitting in the warehouse for weeks. Bell peppers were wrinkled, cucumber was soft. Only the carrots were acceptable. Paying premium prices for subpar produce."

6. ★★★☆☆ (3/5) | USA | Item Type: Pre-cut Vegetables
"Convenient but inconsistent. Sometimes fresh, other times not so much. The pre-cut vegetables often have brown edges and don't last as long as advertised. Bit expensive for what you get."

7. ★☆☆☆☆ (1/5) | New Zealand | Item Type: Fresh Vegetables (Mixed)
"The size of these vegetables is ridiculous! Tiny zucchini being sold at full price, microscopic heads of cauliflower... feels like I'm being ripped off. Won't be shopping here anymore."

8. ★★☆☆☆ (2/5) | Canada | Item Type: Fresh Vegetables (Leafy Greens)
"Kale and spinach arrived with yellow leaves and spots. Had to sort through to find usable pieces. For the price point, this is unacceptable. Going back to my local farmer's market."

9. ★★★☆☆ (3/5) | UK | Item Type: Fresh Vegetables (Mixed)
"Some hits and misses. Green beans and corn were fresh, but the celery was stringy and bitter. Sweet potatoes had several bad spots. Wish they were more consistent."

10. ★☆☆☆☆ (1/5) | USA | Item Type: Organic Vegetables
"These 'organic' vegetables are a joke. Everything is twice the price of regular produce but half the quality. Bruised, damaged, and some items had mold. Complete waste of money. Time to find a new store."

1. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)
Country: USA
Item: Facial Cleansing Brush
"Absolutely love this cleansing brush! My skin feels so much smoother and cleaner after just two weeks of use. The battery life is fantastic, and the different speed settings are perfect for sensitive areas. Worth every penny!"

2. ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
Country: Canada
Item: Natural Deodorant
"Finally found a natural deodorant that actually works! The lavender scent is pleasant and not overpowering. Took about a week for my body to adjust, hence the 4 stars, but now I'm never going back to traditional deodorants."

3. ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)
Country: UK
Item: Electric Toothbrush
"Decent toothbrush with good features, but the battery life isn't great. I find myself charging it more often than advertised. Clean feeling is superior to manual brushing though."

4. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)
Country: Australia
Item: Hair Mask Treatment
"This hair mask is a game changer! My damaged hair feels completely transformed. The smell is divine and a little goes a long way. Have already ordered my second jar!"

5. ⭐⭐ (2/5)
Country: Ireland
Item: Face Moisturizer
"While the texture is nice, it caused some minor breakouts on my sensitive skin. The packaging is beautiful, but I expected better results for the price point."

6. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)
Country: New Zealand
Item: Bamboo Hairbrush
"Sustainable and effective! This brush detangles like a dream and feels so much better than plastic alternatives. The bamboo handle is comfortable and the bristles are gentle yet effective."

7. ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
Country: USA
Item: Electric Nail File
"Great for at-home manicures! Easy to use and multiple attachments included. Only downside is it's a bit loud. Would recommend for anyone looking to save money on salon visits."

8. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)
Country: Singapore
Item: Water Flosser
"Can't believe I waited so long to try this! My dental hygienist noticed the difference after just one month. Easy to use and my gums have never been healthier."

9. ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)
Country: Germany
Item: Body Scrub
"The exfoliation is good and the coffee scent is nice, but it's quite messy to use in the shower. Also, the jar is smaller than expected for the price."

10. ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
Country: Canada
Item: Silk Sleep Mask
"Very comfortable and definitely helps me sleep better. The silk is gentle on my skin and hair. Only complaint is that the elastic started to lose its stretch after about 6 months."

1. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (USA) - Trail Mix Variety Pack
"Perfect balance of sweet and salty! Love the portion-controlled bags for on-the-go snacking. The dried fruits are fresh and nuts are crunchy. Will definitely buy again."

2. ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Canada) - Kettle Cooked Chips
"These chips are incredibly crunchy and flavorful. Only taking off one star because some bags in the multipack were barely half full. Great taste though!"

3. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (UK) - Protein Bars
"Finally found a protein bar that doesn't taste like cardboard! Perfect for post-workout snacking and keeps me full between meals. Love the chocolate peanut butter flavor."

4. ⭐⭐⭐ (Australia) - Dried Fruit Mix
"The mango and pineapple pieces are delicious, but the apples were a bit tough. Good value for money, though wish they'd include more variety."

5. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Mexico) - Spicy Nuts
"¡Increíble! These seasoned nuts are addictive! Perfect heat level and the freshness is outstanding. My whole family loves them."

6. ⭐⭐ (Ireland) - Granola Bites
"Decent taste but way too crumbly. Made a mess everywhere and half the package was just loose granola. Nice flavor but needs better binding."

7. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Singapore) - Seaweed Snacks
"Best seaweed snacks I've tried! Perfect crispness and not too salty. The individual packs keep them fresh. Great low-calorie option."

8. ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Germany) - Pretzel Mix
"Sehr gut! Love the variety of pretzel shapes and the seasoning is perfect. Only complaint is the bag is too small!"

9. ⭐⭐⭐ (Brazil) - Fruit and Nut Bars
"Good natural ingredients and nice texture. However, they're a bit pricey for the size. Would buy again if on sale."

10. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (India) - Spiced Rice Crisps
"Absolutely fantastic! Perfect crunch, great spice blend, and not greasy at all. These are now my go-to evening snack. Please don't ever discontinue these!"

1. ⭐⭐ (2/5) | USA | Ground Beef 80/20
"The color was off when I opened the package, even though it was within the sell-by date. Had a strange grayish tint and an odd smell. Had to return it. Not the first time I've had issues with meat from this store."

2. ⭐ (1/5) | Canada | Chicken Breast
"Extremely disappointed. Found bone fragments in what was supposed to be boneless chicken breast. Could have been dangerous if I hadn't noticed while cooking. Not acceptable for the premium price."

3. ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5) | UK | Pork Chops
"Mixed feelings about these pork chops. The quality seems inconsistent - sometimes they're great, other times they're tough and fatty. Price keeps increasing while portions get smaller."

4. ⭐ (1/5) | Australia | Lamb Leg
"Purchased for Sunday roast - was shocked to find the meat had gone bad despite being well within the use-by date. Terrible waste of money and ruined our family dinner."

5. ⭐⭐ (2/5) | Ireland | Ground Turkey
"Too much liquid in the package - feels like I'm paying for water weight. The meat itself was okay, but not worth the price. Will buy elsewhere from now on."

6. ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5) | USA | Ribeye Steak
"Decent meat but seriously overpriced for the quality. The marbling was minimal for a ribeye, and the cut was thinner than advertised. At least it tasted okay."

7. ⭐ (1/5) | New Zealand | Chicken Thighs
"Found plastic pieces mixed in with the meat. Absolutely unacceptable! The store manager was apologetic, but this is a serious quality control issue."

8. ⭐⭐ (2/5) | Canada | Beef Brisket
"Way too much fat, even for brisket. After trimming, I lost almost 40% of what I paid for. The meat that was left was good, but not worth the inflated price."

9. ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5) | USA | Italian Sausage
"The seasoning is good, but the amount of gristle in these sausages is disappointing. Sometimes they're great, other times it's like they used all the scraps."

10. ⭐ (1/5) | UK | Ground Pork
"Expiration date showed 5 days left but when I opened it the next day, it was already turning brown. The smell was off too. Had to throw it away. Complete waste of money."

1. ★☆☆☆☆ (1/5) | USA | Strawberries
"Purchased these strawberries yesterday and they were already molding today. Half the container was completely inedible. Waste of $6.99. Will not buy produce from here again."

2. ★★☆☆☆ (2/5) | Canada | Mixed Fruit Bowl
"The presentation looked nice, but most fruits were either overripe or underripe. The pineapple was sour and the grapes were mushy. The apples were decent though."

3. ★☆☆☆☆ (1/5) | UK | Bananas
"Ordered bananas for delivery - received completely green, unripe ones that never properly ripened, just went from green to brown. Very disappointing."

4. ★★★☆☆ (3/5) | Australia | Mangoes
"Mixed feelings about these mangoes. Price was good and 2 out of 4 were perfect, but the others had brown spots inside. Wish there was better quality control."

5. ★☆☆☆☆ (1/5) | Ireland | Red Grapes
"Expensive for what you get. Found multiple spider webs in the bag and the grapes were falling off the stems. Completely unacceptable quality."

6. ★★☆☆☆ (2/5) | USA | Watermelon
"Pre-cut watermelon was flavorless and mealy. I know it's off-season but they shouldn't sell it if it's this poor quality. At least it wasn't spoiled."

7. ★★★☆☆ (3/5) | Canada | Apples
"Honey Crisp apples were bruised and had several soft spots. Taste was okay when you cut around the bad parts. A bit overpriced for the quality."

8. ★☆☆☆☆ (1/5) | New Zealand | Berries Mix
"Found mold in both the blueberries and raspberries upon opening. Date showed still fresh but clearly wasn't. Complete waste of money."

9. ★★☆☆☆ (2/5) | USA | Peaches
"Rock hard when purchased, told they would ripen at home. They went from hard straight to rotten with no in-between. Very frustrating experience."

10. ★★★☆☆ (3/5) | UK | Citrus Selection
"Oranges were fine but the lemons were dried out and the limes were already turning brown. Expected better for the premium price point. At least the oranges saved this from a lower rating."

1. ★☆☆☆☆
Country: USA
Item Type: Organic Baby Food Puree - Stage 2
"ABSOLUTELY HORRIFIED! Found a small piece of hard plastic in my 8-month-old's sweet potato puree. Could have choked my baby! Immediately reported to the company and FDA. Will NEVER purchase again. Save your children from this negligent company!"

2. ★☆☆☆☆
Country: Canada
Item Type: Baby Food Pouches - Fruit & Veggie Blend
"Disgusting! Opened a pouch that was clearly spoiled despite being within expiration date. Had a rancid smell and strange color. My daughter got sick after eating from a different pouch from the same batch. Completely unacceptable for baby food!"

3. ★☆☆☆☆
Country: UK
Item Type: Infant Rice Cereal
"What kind of company puts PLASTIC in baby food?! Found shards of clear plastic mixed in with the cereal. This is criminal negligence! Keeping all evidence for legal action. Parents, please check every spoonful carefully!"

4. ★☆☆☆☆
Country: Australia
Item Type: Baby Food Jar - Chicken & Vegetables

5. ★☆☆☆☆

6. ★☆☆☆☆
Country: Ireland
Item Type: Baby Breakfast Cereal
"Three pouches in this batch had plastic pieces mixed in. COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE! My poor baby could have been seriously harmed. Taking this to trading standards and warning every parent I know. Disgusting company!"

7. ★☆☆☆☆
Country: Canada
Item Type: Pureed Baby Food - Mixed Vegetables

"Opened a jar to find it FERMENTING despite being months from expiration! The sound it made when opening was like a champagne pop. Could have poisoned my baby! This company should be shut down!"

10. ★☆☆☆☆
Country: UK
Item Type: Baby Food Pouches - Veggie Blend
"Third time finding foreign objects in these pouches - this time it was clear plastic! Previous times were dark plastic pieces. Reported each time but nothing changes. DO NOT TRUST this brand with your precious little ones!"
